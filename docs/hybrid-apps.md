I'm looking for a framework to create an Android app.
I've tried the native android app, but Java sucks and Scala has not
been fully supported  on Android.

## Frontend options:

* Cordova: Apache's mobile app build platform, the basic solution
* PhoneGap: Adobe's solution based on `Cordova`, with more utilities
* Ionic: AngularJS + SASS + Cordova
* trigger.io: Appcelerator's cloud based solution, fast build
* Steroids: AppGvyer's cloud based solution, free but immature
* NativeScript: A full feature solution

## Backend options:

* Parse
* Firebase
* Leancloud
